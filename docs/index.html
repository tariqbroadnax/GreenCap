				<p>This project is an example of simple approach to real-time multiplayer networking. No complex networking is involved. Nor can you do much. In fact, the player can only move and by extension, see other players moving. Although the project is limited, it is shows some of the difficulties that even a simple networking project like this may face and is a good starting point for more passionate projects.</p>

<p><strong>What language was this project developed in?</strong><br>
Java. Java has a good built-in library and is easy to program in.</p>
<p><strong>What networking protocol does this project use?</strong><br>
TCP. I am not very knowledgable about networking and so I used the most simple option, Javaâ€™s TCP framework. In fact, this project only uses two networking classes: <code>Socket</code> and <code>ServerSocket</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Is this a game?</strong><br>
No, unless you consider moving around in the endless oblivion as a game. However, it could be one but I am not interested in going forward with such a project.</p>
