				<p>This project is an example of naive and simple approach to real-time multiplayer networking. No complex networking is involved. Nor can you do much. In fact, the player can only move and by extension, see other players moving. Although the project is limited, it is shows some of the difficulties that even a simple networking project like this may face and is a good starting point for more passionate projects. </p>

<p>This project was developed in Java. Java, being my favorite language, has a good built-in library and is easy to program in. That is, this project was easy to get up and running. For sumplicity, the netcode uses TCP.</p>
