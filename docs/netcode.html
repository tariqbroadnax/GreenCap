			<p>The network consists of two actors, the client and server.</p>
<h1><a id="Client_2"></a>Client</h1>
<p>On initialization, the client attempts to connect to the server. If the client cannot connect, then an <code>IOException</code> is thrown and nothing is loaded. Otherwise, the client recieves their player’s name and loads everything else.</p>
<p>Every frame, the client checks whether they have recieved and/or should send commands.</p>
<p>Once the client recieves a command, the client updates their local scene.</p>
<p>Whenever the user presses an arrow key, a move command is created. The move command is of the following format as a string: <code>move [movex] [movey]</code></p>
<p>The movex and movey specify the direction that the player is moving.</p>
<p>After the command is created, the command is executed, updating the local scene. This is a form interpolation that makes the program feel tighter. But it does not necessary reflect the actual state of the scene on the server.</p>
<p>After, the client sends the command to server. Server recieves and executes the command.</p>
<h1><a id="Server_19"></a>Server</h1>
<p>The Server runs on two threads: the connector thread and the update thread.</p>
<p>The connector thread connects with clients. It blocks until a client attempts to connect with it. After it creates a unique player name and sends it to the client. Normally, another thread would be created for this intital session but it is unnecessary since the initial interaction between the server and client is minimal. Aftewards, the server continues to block and listen on this thread.</p>
<p>The update thread updates the scene. It first checks if any clients have sent any commands and executes them. No form of validation is executed. It then updates the server’s scene. After it sends each client a update command for each player. The command is in the following format as a string: <code>player [playerAttr0] [playerAttr1] ...</code></p>
<p>In the event that any of this fails, the server disconnects with client immediately.</p>
